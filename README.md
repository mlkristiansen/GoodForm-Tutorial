GoodForm Tutorial
===

This project contains the source code that underpins the [GoodForm Tutorial](https://github.com/nerdErg/GoodForm/blob/master/tutorial/01-Introduction.md) project.

The tutorial contains two controllers which demonstrate simple GoodForm definitions:

* ContactDetailsFormController
* JobApplicationFormController

In order for the form definitions to be displayed correctly, a [OneRing](http://nerderg.com/One+Ring) instance is required to be running.  The rulesets that underpin the form controllers are contained in the `rulesets` subdirectory.
